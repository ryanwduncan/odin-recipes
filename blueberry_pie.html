    <h1>Homemade Blueberry Pie</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nothing screams "summer" quite like blueberry pie. This top-rated blueberry recipe will quickly become a seasonal
        staple in your home!
        You can keep covered blueberry pie at room temperature for about two days. If you intend to keep the pie longer
        than that, you should keep it in the refrigerator. It will last there for up to five days.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Sugar: </em>This blueberry pie recipe starts with a cup of white sugar.</li>
        <li><em>Cornstarch: </em>Cornstarch thickens the blueberry pie filling, preventing runniness.</li>
        <li><em>Cinnamon: </em>Ground cinnamon adds subtle warmth.</li>
        <li><em>Salt: </em>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the blueberry pie filling, but it won't make
            it taste salty.</li>
        <li><em>>Blueberries: </em>Of course, you'll need fresh blueberries! If you can't find fresh, frozen (and
            thawed) will work.</li>
        <li><em>Pie crust: </em>Use a store-bought or homemade pastry crust.</li>
        <li><em>Butter: </em>You'll need just a tablespoon of butter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Sprinkle the berries with sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li>2. Pour the filling into the bottom pie crust and finish with a lattice crust on top.</li>
        <li>3. Bake until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden.</li>
    </ol>
