    <h1>Truffle Lovers' Popcorn</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The flavors of truffle oil, parsley, and Parmesan cheese combine to create a whimsical gourmet appetizer or
        snack.
        I like to make this homemade popcorn with peanut oil due to its high smoke point, but if you have allergies,
        substitute it with vegetable oil. With all the artificial ingredients and disregard for our health in
        store-bought microwave popcorn, I've been making homemade popcorn every weekend the old-fashioned way.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 teaspoons white truffle oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 (3.5 ounce) package microwave popcorn, popped</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt, or to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Mix the truffle oil, parsley, and Parmesan cheese in a heat-safe bowl.</li>
        <li>2. Place unopened package of popcorn into center of microwave oven; cook on High power until the bag fills
            with popped corn and the pops occur about 2 seconds apart (1 1/2 to 4 minutes, depending on oven's power).
            Open hot bag carefully and pour into bowl. Toss with truffle oil mixture; season to taste with sea salt.
        </li>
    </ol>
